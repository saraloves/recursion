// If life was easy, we could just do things the easy way:
// var getElementsByClassName = function (className) {
//   return document.getElementsByClassName(className);
// };

// But instead we're going to implement it from scratch:
var getElementsByClassName = function (className) {
  // your code here
};


Tuhin Notes

document.body //the body

[document.body].childNodes


iterating over the children and doing something like checking 
the tags
and recursively passing in the children to your function

For each node it checks for children
